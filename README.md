This library was inspired by work by Daniel Contreras and Craig Schindler during their Ph.D.
at UC Berkeley under Professor Kristofer Pister. Their Ph.D. dissertations can be found 
[here](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-18.html) and

to them for providing the preliminary MATLAB simulation scripts they used in their dissertations.
